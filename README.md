In this project we detect the multiple objects in an given picture and and uploaded video . for this we used algorithms like yolov3 and darknet-53 which is the main backbone of the the project it is the algorithm that is available in CNN it has number of layers of networks which were used to seperate the image and train the model to detect object. the train model will first split the image into number of layers and tehn it identify the object in the image by the pixels in the image after all the layers work done the bounding boxes will add to the image and colors will be given to the differnrt objects then the name of the objects are alloted to the image as per the detection the final output will show in the stored place and will be available to the user to see. the detection will also show the percentage of how clarity the image is .
